This is a placeholder file indicating where the Stockfish WASM binary should be placed.

To obtain the binary without relying on a CDN:
1. Download an official Stockfish WASM build (e.g. from https://stockfishchess.org/download/).
2. Copy the downloaded `stockfish.wasm` into this directory, replacing this placeholder.
3. Ensure the companion JavaScript glue file points to the local WASM path if required.

The development build references this path during bundling. If the file is missing at runtime,
client-side analysis will fall back to the server engine when available.
